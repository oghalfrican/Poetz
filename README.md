# Poetz
The poem I created used text from the book "The Time Traveller" by H.G. Wells. I chose that book because I'm a big Sci-Fi fan, and it is one of the oldest books within the genre. For my poem, I wanted to make it as random, yet cohesive as possible. Within Google Colab, I created this poem that gives a lot of hints of mystery surrounding what exactly the characters in the poem are engaging about. This poem is just another example of what coding can do to change the norm of poetry. Enjoy!

Here's the Final Product:

“That’s a simple
point of psychology.
Some of my results are curious.
“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.
Then Filby said he was damned.
But how about up and down?
I jump back for a moment.
I should have thought of it.
